      <h2>Pat's Story</h2>
      <p>
        In 2021, armed with family recipes and an idea, Pat, opened the first Pat's Salmon Cookies. Pat's first
        location, located in the famous Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle, Washington was soon followed by many more
        locations around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        On opening day, Pat had no idea that the Salmon Cookies would become a favorite around the globe. What makes
        Pat's cookies so great? They are delicious cookies made into the shape of a salmon, that have just a hint of
        fishy goodness.
